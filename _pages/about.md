# Urban Planner | Data Enthusiast | Aspiring PhD Researcher
-------------------------------

**Welcome!**  
Hello! I am Md. Ahnaf Nafi, a student of **Urban and Regional Planning (URP)** at BUET, Bangladesh. My academic journey revolves around exploring **urbanization, migration, statistical analysis, and civil engineering principles**. Alongside planning, I have cultivated a deep interest in **data science, machine learning, deep learning and environmental studies**, working with tools like ArcGIS, R-Studio, PTV Vissim and Excel.

This website is a reflection of my academic interests, research projects, and professional goals. As I transition into the world of **data analytics and advanced research**, I aim to blend my background in **urban planning** with **machine learning models**, particularly in the environmental and transportation domains.

Current Goals
========
ðŸ“Œ Applying for PhD Programs in the USA with a focus on environmental science and machine learning applications.  
ðŸ“Œ Expanding my skills in data analytics and building meaningful, impactful models.  
ðŸ“Œ Exploring opportunities for collaborative research and contributing to the scientific community.
