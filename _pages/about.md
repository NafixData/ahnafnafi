# Urban Planner | Data Enthusiast | Aspiring Researcher
-------------------------------

**Welcome!**  
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  
I am a student of  <b>Urban and Regional Planning (URP)</b> at BUET, Bangladesh. My academic journey revolves around exploring <b>urbanization, migration, statistical analysis, and civil engineering principles </b>. Alongside planning, I have cultivated a deep interest in <b>Data Science<b> specially in <b> Machine Learning and Deep Learning</b>, working with tools like ArcGIS, R-Studio, PTV Vissim and Excel. <br>

This website is a reflection of my academic interests, research projects, and professional goals. As I transition into the world of <b>data analytics and advanced research </b>, I aim to blend my background in <b>urban planning </b> with <b>machine learning models </b>, particularly in the environmental and transportation domains.
</p>

Current Goals
========
- Applying for PhD Programs in the USA with a focus on environmental science and machine learning applications.  
- Expanding my skills in data analytics and building meaningful, impactful models.  
- Exploring opportunities for collaborative research and contributing to the scientific community.
