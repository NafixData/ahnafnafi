# Urban Planner | Aspiring Researcher
-------------------------------

**Welcome!**  

  
I've graduated from Urban and Regional Planning (URP), from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh. Now, I'm preparing myself to pursure higher education further. My academic journey revolved around exploring planning in different sectors like- Housing, Transportation, Environment, Geography. These inter-related and multi-dimentional sectors required a lot of data analysis tools as well.  

**Research Interest** 
- Transportation planning
- Environmental Engineering (Prediction Models)
- Geography and GIS
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This website is a reflection of my academic interests, research projects, and professional goals. Here, I tried to blend my background in urban planning  with machine learning models, particularly in the environmental and transportation domains.

**Current Goals**
- Applying for Graduate Programs with a focus on machine learning applications in (Transportation and Environment).  
- Expanding my skills in data analytics and building meaningful, impactful models.
