Research
=======
## Undergraduate Thesis
**Thesis Title:** Predicting The Development Phases and Their Impact on Air Quality in Dhaka Metropolitan Region Using Deep Learning (_2025_)   
   <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <b>Supervisor:</b> Dr. Dipita Hossain; Assistant Professor, Department of Urban and Regional Planning <br>
     <br>
     <b>Description:</b> This study investigates the impact of urban development on air quality in certain regions of Dhaka using sky images. A predictive model, built on the ResNet-50 architecture, classifies urban areas based on their development phases and air quality levels. The study also creates a novel image database (Infra-Nafi) for air quality prediction. Findings suggest a strong correlation between urban development and elevated PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels, with a recommendation to incorporate green infrastructure and raise public awareness to mitigate air pollution.

## Transportation Projects 

**1 Title: Traffic Impact Assessment of Kemal Ataturk Avenue: Development Scenarios Based on RAJUK’s Poripotro(circular)**
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <b>Description:</b> This project aims to conduct a Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA) for the planned commercialization of Kamal Atatürk Avenue in Banani, Dhaka. According to DAP (Detailed Area Plan) guidelines, the area's proposed land use includes mostly residential zones. However, with potential commercialization, building heights may increase, affecting the transportation network. The TIA seeks to predict increased traffic, pinpoint bottlenecks, and propose solutions to manage congestion and safety risks effectively. Objectives include assessing traffic impacts, modeling scenarios with maximum building heights, and estimating traffic from high-traffic-generating uses.
  </div> 

**2 Title: Transport Modeling for Urban Planning and Traffic Management** 
   <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <b>Description:</b> This project focuses on transport modeling to predict traffic patterns and transportation behavior. Key components such as trip generation, trip distribution, and mode split are analyzed using Gravity and Logit models. Python is used to estimate trip patterns, create an origin-destination matrix, and assess transportation models. The study provides insights into urban mobility, essential for traffic management and infrastructure planning.
   </div> 
------------------------------- 

## Environment Projects 

**3 Title: A Study on the Renovated Parks in Dhaka North City Corporation: Exploring the Perception of the Park Users**
   <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <b>Description:</b> Conducted a study on the physical characteristics and users' perceptions of Tajmahal Road Park in Mohammadpur, Dhaka, after renovation. The research involved physical and social surveys to assess the park’s condition and gather insights, aiming to provide recommendations for improving urban parks in Dhaka based on international standards.
   </div>  

**4 Title: Site Planning of Dhanmondi Lake Integrated Park**
   <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <b>Description:</b> Conducted a physical survey of Dhanmondi Lake Park to assess its current state, focusing on its environmental, social, and economic features. The study addressed issues related to unregulated urban expansion, pollution, and infrastructure deterioration. It highlighted past regeneration efforts and identified gaps in the physical aspects of the park’s management. Based on fieldwork and literature review of international parks, several recommendations were proposed to improve the park's condition and sustainability.
   </div>  
------------------------------- 

## Geography Projects 

**5 Title: A Study on Redevelopment of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) WARD-21**
   <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <b>Description:</b> Conducted a study on the redevelopment of DNCC Ward-21 in north and middle Badda, focusing on identifying issues faced by the entire community. Developed a vision and mission for revitalizing the area, proposing policies to enhance recreational facilities, amenities, drainage, and promote non-motorized transport. The study created a phased implementation plan to address challenges and improve the quality of life for residents of all backgrounds.
   </div>  
  
**6 Title: A Study on the Government NGO and CBO Initiatives for Rural Development in Bangladesh**
   <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <b>Description:</b> Conducted a study on rural development in Bangladesh, analyzing the initiatives of GOs, NGOs, and CBOs, and assessing rural people's perceptions through 290 surveys across seven upazilas. The study identified key challenges, including limited awareness of agriculture-related initiatives, gender disparities in service access, and the lack of disaster preparedness. It recommended enhancing agricultural awareness, promoting gender equity in service provision, improving disaster management, and fostering collaboration between GOs and CBOs for better community participation.
   </div> 

**7 Title: A Study on Urban Pond Management at the Local Level and the Role of Stakeholders**
   <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <b>Description:</b> This study examines the management of Kalibari Pond in Dhaka, focusing on historical context, stakeholder roles, and challenges such as waste accumulation and pondside erosion. Through 
     field surveys and discussions, the study identifies issues in pond management, influenced by political factors. Policy recommendations include zoning, pond restoration, community engagement, and water 
     quality management to preserve urban ponds. The findings emphasize the importance of sustainable practices and public awareness for effective pond conservation.
