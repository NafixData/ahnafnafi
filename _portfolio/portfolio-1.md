  This project focuses on the development and implementation of transport modelling techniques using Python to analyze and predict the behavior of transportation
  systems. 
  <b> Objectives: </b> To simulate trip distributions, mode choices, and trip generation based on socioeconomic and land use data for effective transportation 
  planning. <br>
  ![Project Visual Abstract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NafixData/ahnafnafi/master/images/Steps.png)
  <b> Methodology:</b> Mathematical models such as the gravity model for trip distribution and utility-based models for mode choice, supported by Python coding for 
  data processing and analysis.
  <b>Key findings: </b> Include the successful estimation of trip matrices and mode split probabilities, which provide valuable insights into travel behavior patterns 
  and infrastructure needs. This project demonstrates the potential of Python-based transport modelling to improve decision-making in urban transportation systems by 
  accurately predicting trip flows and traveler preferences.
  The project outcomes highlight important implications for urban planners and policy makers aiming to optimize transportation networks, reduce congestion, and 
  enhance mobility options. Future work may extend the model to incorporate real-time data and further refine predictive accuracy.
