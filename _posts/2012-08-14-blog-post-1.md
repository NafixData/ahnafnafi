## **Road to the Heaven**

The road twisted upward, unraveling like a loose thread from the spool of the earth. As we climbed, the three of us—me, Ravi, and Deepak—talked to keep the cold at bay. Words floated in the thin air, small puffs of warmth against the growing chill. Ahead of us, our guide, Dawa, walked with the calm ease of someone who belonged to these heights. The rest of us, city folk stumbling through a world far older and wilder than we understood, lagged behind.

“You know, they say the Himalayas are home to gods,” Deepak said, his voice muffled under the woolen scarf wrapped tightly around his face. “Every peak has a story—some god or demon resting at the top.”

Ravi gave a breathless laugh, shifting his backpack on his shoulders.  
“Let’s hope the gods are in a good mood today.”

“Or at least the demons are asleep,” I added, exhaling misty breath into the cold.

Dawa, overhearing us, glanced back with a small smile.  
“The mountains don’t need gods or demons to test you. They do that on their own.”

His words settled between us like the falling snow, light but heavy with meaning. The path we followed wound through dense pine forests, the trees dark and silent, their branches sagging under the weight of snow. It felt like we were walking into a story—not one we controlled, but one the mountains were writing for us.  

“Have you ever seen anything strange up here, Dawa?” Deepak asked, always the curious one.

“Strange? All the time,” Dawa said with a chuckle. “Once, I was leading a group near the Kangchenjunga base, and we got caught in a storm. When the snow cleared, one of the porters swore he saw something—like a shadow, big as a man, but running on all fours. He said it was a *yeti*.”

“A yeti? Come on,” Ravi scoffed, though his voice wavered slightly.

Dawa only shrugged.  
“Some things you don’t need to believe in to be afraid of them.”

We fell silent for a while after that, each of us lost in thought. There was something about the mountains—their vastness, their silence—that made you feel both humbled and unnerved. My gaze wandered to the peaks around us, their snow-covered summits piercing the sky like jagged blades. Somewhere far ahead, hidden in mist and snow, was Sandakphu, the highest point in West Bengal. It was a place people climbed to catch a glimpse of four of the world’s tallest mountains—Everest, Makalu, Lhotse, and Kangchenjunga.

“You think we’ll see Everest from the top?” Ravi asked, already short of breath from the climb.

“If the clouds let us,” I replied. “Everest is supposed to show herself only when she wants to.”

Dawa turned slightly, adjusting the strap of his pack.  
“They say Kangchenjunga is sacred, you know. Locals believe the mountain has five treasures—gold, grain, books, jewels, and medicine—and it only reveals them to those who are pure of heart.”

“Guess we’re out of luck then,” Deepak said with a grin, nudging Ravi in the ribs.

Ravi grinned back.  
“Yeah, I don’t think the gods hand out treasure to people who cheat at 29.”

We all laughed, the sound bright in the cold air, but it quickly faded, swallowed by the vastness around us.

## **The Road Grows Steeper**

As we climbed higher, conversation dwindled, replaced by the sound of boots crunching on snow and the sharp inhale of cold air. The wind picked up, whipping at our faces, and the sky above us stretched wide and pale, as if the heavens were pulling away.

By the time we crossed the invisible border between Nepal and India, the path had grown narrow and treacherous, twisting like a serpent through the mountainside. Sandakphu waited somewhere beyond the mist, but it felt less like a destination and more like a gatekeeper, testing our endurance. On either side of the border, a few hotels stood, small outposts clinging to the mountains like stubborn weeds.

“This must be the loneliest place in the world,” Deepak muttered, rubbing his hands together.

“The mountains are never lonely,” Dawa said. “They are just quiet.”

“Too quiet,” Ravi added under his breath, pulling his jacket tighter.

The snow began falling in earnest as the last light of day slipped behind the peaks. By the time we reached the wooden cottage where we’d stay for the night, the wind had turned fierce, biting at any exposed skin. The cottage stood huddled against the hillside, as if it had learned long ago to keep its head down and weather whatever the mountain threw at it.

Inside, the air was dry and smelled faintly of old woodsmoke. The walls were thin, and the few solar lamps flickered weakly, casting dim, wavering light. We settled in as best we could, huddling beneath thick blankets, trying to shake off the chill that clung to us like a second skin. But the cold was relentless, seeping through the walls, the floor, and even our clothes, as if determined to remind us that the mountain didn’t care whether we were prepared or not.

## **A Sudden Collapse**

We were sitting together, sipping tea and shuffling a worn deck of cards, when it happened.

One moment, Deepak was laughing, throwing down a card with mock triumph, and the next, he crumpled to the floor, gasping for breath. His face turned pale as the snow outside, and his hands clutched at his chest, fingers clawing at the fabric of his jacket.

“Deepak!” Ravi shouted, scrambling to his side.

I knelt beside him, panic gripping me as I watched him struggle for air, his eyes wide with fear.  
“What’s happening? What’s wrong?”

“The cold,” Dawa said grimly, already moving to wrap Deepak in blankets.  
“It’s hit him harder than we thought.”

We piled every blanket we could find onto him, but it felt hopeless—like trying to fight a blizzard with nothing but bare hands. His breathing was ragged, each inhale a battle, each exhale a plea.

“We need to keep him awake,” Dawa said urgently.  
“Talk to him. Don’t let him fall asleep.”

“Deepak, stay with us, man,” Ravi whispered, his voice trembling. “Come on, remember that time we played cards all night and I beat you six times in a row?”

Deepak managed a weak smile, though his breath still came in shallow, desperate gulps.  
“You cheated… every time.”

“I did not!” Ravi shot back, forcing a grin through the fear that gripped him.  
“You’re just a sore loser.”

We tried to keep things light, but the weight of the night pressed heavily on us, making every word, every gesture feel fragile. We played 29 again, but the cards felt cold and lifeless in our hands. Ravi brewed tea, each sip burning against the cold creeping into our bones. The hours crawled by, every minute stretching unbearably as we watched Deepak’s shallow breaths, terrified that the next one might be his last.

## **The Longest Night**

The night felt endless, thick and oppressive, as if the mountains were testing our endurance. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the thin walls, and the dim light of the solar lamp flickered like a heartbeat about to stop. Every breath Deepak took was a reminder of how close we were to losing him.

“We just need to make it to morning,” Dawa said quietly, as if speaking louder might disturb the fragile thread holding Deepak to us.

We nodded, though none of us dared to say what we were really thinking: *What if morning never came?*

But finally, after what felt like an eternity, the first hint of dawn seeped into the room—a pale, fragile light, soft as the edge of a whisper.

Deepak stirred, weak but alive. Relief washed over us in waves, though it was tempered by exhaustion and the unshakable knowledge that the night had changed us.

As we packed our bags in silence, the cards lay scattered on the floor—a quiet reminder of the hours spent teetering between hope and fear.

The mountains had spared us, but they had taken something in return—a piece of our courage, a sliver of our joy. And as we began the long descent, the snow beneath our feet seemed softer, almost mocking, as if to say, *Was it really worth it?*

Some journeys don’t leave you with triumph or joy. Some leave you with shadows—quiet, lingering things that follow you home. The mountains had given us a lesson that night, and it was a harsh one: Nature is beautiful, yes—but it is also merciless. And in the end, it always keeps the last word for itself.
