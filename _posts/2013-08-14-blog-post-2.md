I've recently finished my undergraduate. It was a great experience for me as I explored not only departmental courses but also some non-departmental topics. This blog describes the journey of my academic life.

Timeline Wise......
======

All of my closest friends went to different institutions after completing the Secondary School Certificate exam. So, I was a bit of unhappy for this lose. Anyway, after starting the regular classes, I managed to be serious with my academic works as soon as I found chemistry quite interesting and eventually scored almost perfect in the final. While studing Physics, Chemistry and Maths, I made the decision to study Mechanical Engineering at the best university of my country. Though I could not manage to get my dream department, somewhat I managed to admit into my dream university.

First Year
------
I got the opportunity to study Urban and Regional Planning. This department hampered all of my interest as all the courses was theoritical and design related. I had a dream of designing machine but in return I had to design city which is also very subjective, in contrast to my belief of in objective results. On the other hand, COVID-19 spread out all over the world and our offline classes shifted to online. This incident also demotivated me as it was very challenging for me to understand topics via online sources. There was certainly no campus life, no offline friends and no offline classes. It was a hectic starting for me. Finally, Urban Planning principles and architectural designs caused the death of my Mechanical Engineering dream. 

Second Year
------
I would love to mention a person, my home tutor, my school, college and university alumni, Mr. Shakti Banik. He was the only one who really helped me to overcome the academic boringness my teaching me some basic codes of Proteus ISIS and <b>Arduino<b>.
