I've finished my undergraduate recently. It was a great experience for me as I explored not only departmental courses but also non-departmental courses which I found interesting. This blog describes the journey of my academic life.

Timeline Wise......
======

All of my closest friends went to different institutions after completing the Secondary School Certificate exam. I was a bit of unhappy for this lose. Anyway, after starting the regular classes, I managed to be serious with my academic works and found chemistry quite interesting and eventually scored almost perfect. While studing Physics, Chemistry and Maths, I made a decision to study Mechanical Engineering.Though I could not manage to get my dream department as it was so competative, somewhat managed to admit into my dream university. But the departmental courses didn't seem to suit me.
