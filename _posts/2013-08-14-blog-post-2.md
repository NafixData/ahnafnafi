I've finished my undergraduate recently. It was a great experience for me as I explored not only departmental courses but also non-departmental courses which I found interesting. This blog describes the journey of my academic life.

Timeline Wise......
======

All of my closest friends went to different institutions after completing the Secondary School Certificate exam. I was a bit of unhappy for this lose. Anyway, after starting the regular classes, I managed to be serious with my academic works and found chemistry quite interesting and eventually scored almost perfect. While studing Physics, Chemistry and Maths, I made a decision to study Mechanical Engineering.Though I could not manage to get my dream department as it was so competative, somewhat managed to admit into my dream university. But the departmental courses didn't seem to suit me.

First Year of University
------
I got the opportunity to study Urban and Regional Planning. This department hampered all of my interest as all the courses was theoritical and design related. I had a dream of designing machine my in return I had to design city which is also very subjective but I believe in objective output. On the other hand, COVID-19 spread out all over the world and our offline classes shifted to online. This incident also demotivated me as welll. No campus life, no offline friends, no offline classes. It was really a hectic journey for me. Urban Planning principles, architectural designs caused the death of my Mechanical Engineering dream. 

Second Year of University
------
As soon as I promoted to second year, Civil Engineering courses
